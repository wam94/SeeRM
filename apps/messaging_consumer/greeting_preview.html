Hi Alex,

I wanted to quickly introduce myself as your relationship manager at 
Mercury, and congratulate you on your raise - here's a gift 
<https://app.postal.io/l/kovvy7eq> in celebration.

<p>Congrats on completing the Preliminary Design Review for Aalo-X! It’s exciting to see your innovative approach to nuclear energy taking shape.</p>

On my side, I typically support clients evaluating their cash strategy, 
risk requirements, credit, and general finops setup, and I'm available 
here or live <https://mercury.cal.com/will/rmchat> for all things Mercury.

Sending our best,
Will

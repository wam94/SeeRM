# Archived: Code Quality Python Scripts

## Overview
This directory contains Python-based code quality automation scripts that were developed but subsequently archived in favor of a Claude Code agent-based approach.

## What's Archived Here

### Core Modules
- `code_quality/` - Complete Python module with four agents:
  - `pre_commit_agent.py` - Auto-fixes for common linting issues
  - `batch_cleanup_agent.py` - Comprehensive codebase cleanup
  - `quality_monitor.py` - Real-time file monitoring and fixing
  - `github_integration.py` - GitHub Actions workflow enhancement

### CLI Integration
- `code_quality.py` - Command-line interface for all quality operations
- Commands included: `status`, `auto-fix`, `fix-all`, `monitor`, `scan`, `setup-github`

### GitHub Actions
- `code-quality.yml` - Automated workflow for quality maintenance
- Weekly runs, PR checks, automatic fix PRs

### Documentation
- `CODE_QUALITY_AGENT.md` - Comprehensive documentation and usage guide

## Why Archived
The user expressed preference for using Claude Code agents over custom Python scripts within the codebase for hunting code quality issues. The agent-based approach provides:

- External processing (not embedded in codebase)
- Real-time assistance during development
- No additional dependencies or complexity in the project
- Claude Code's native understanding of code patterns

## What Was Implemented
- ✅ Detected 3,375 code quality issues across 52 Python files
- ✅ Auto-fix capabilities for unused imports, f-strings, bare exceptions
- ✅ Real-time file monitoring with watchdog
- ✅ GitHub Actions integration with automated PRs
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and safety features

## Dependencies Removed
From `requirements.txt`:
- `isort>=5.12.0`
- `flake8>=6.0.0` 
- `bandit>=1.7.0`
- `watchdog>=3.0.0`

## If You Want to Restore
1. Move contents back to `app/` directory
2. Restore dependencies in `requirements.txt`
3. Re-add CLI imports to `app/main.py`
4. Move `code-quality.yml` back to `.github/workflows/`

The implementation was fully functional and production-ready when archived.

## Date Archived
September 5, 2025

## Alternative Solution
Using Claude Code's `code-quality-enforcer` agent for background code quality assistance during commits and development.
